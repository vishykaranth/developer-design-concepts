			<h2>Functional programming with Spock and Geb</h2>
			<p>This application is a simple web interface.</p>

<p>			
	It is used as an example for <a href="http://www.gebish.org/">Geb</a> tests. Although it is created with <a href="http://spring.io/">Spring</a>, it could
	actually use any technology, as functional tests with Spock/Geb treat the system as a black box.
</p> 

<p>
The code was created strictly for illustration purposes. A production ready
application would have many more details and error checking.
