Because you have let them distract you. Blind you with hate. 
You cannot see the battle for what it is. We are fighting to save one another
. We must realize we are not alone. We rise and fall together. 
And some of us must be sacrificed if all are to be saved. 
Because if you fail in this then none of us will be saved, 
and the Narn will be only a memory.  
You have the opportunity here and now to choose, to 
become something greater and nobler and more difficult than you have been before. 
The universe does not offer such chances often, G'Kar.
