## Lessons 01

- Work is not done when Developer completes the implementation of a feature rather,
    - it is only done when our application is running successfully in production,
    - delivering value to the customer.
- By putting all work for each work center in queues and making it visible,
    - all stakeholders can more easily prioritize work in the context of global goals.
- Doing this enables each work center to single-task on the highest priority work until it is completed,
    - increasing throughput.    
- Controlling queue size [WIP] is an extremely powerful management tool,
    - as it is one of the few leading indicators of lead time—with most work items,
    - we don’t know how long it will take until it’s actually completed.
- Stop starting. Start finishing.
- Break complex work in multiple simple tasks and start ticking the boxes and make progress towards the desired goals.

### Lessons - The passionate programmer.  
- Schedule lunch with a businessperson.
    - Talk to them about how they do their job.
    - As you talk to them, ask yourself what you would have to change or learn if you aspired to have their job.
    - Ask about the specifics of their daily work.
    - Talk to them about how technology helps them (or slows them down) on the job.
    - Think about your work from their perspective.
    - Do this regularly.        
- The people around you affect your own performance. Choose your crowd wisely.
  - Attempting to be the worst actually stops you from selling yourself short.
  - Developers are often looking for spare-time projects on which to practice new techniques and hone their skills.

- Invest in Your Intelligence
- Don’t Listen to Your Parents
- Fear-driven career planning is more likely to land you in a cubicle farm for the rest of your life than on the path to greatness. Sure, it’s safe, but it’s no fun.
- If you’ve worked in only one place and seen one set of systems, many (smart) managers would see that as a strike against you when making a hiring decision. I’d personally rather hire someone who has seen a variety of successes and failures in different environments than someone who has known only one way of doing things.
- Take calculated risks with your career.Don’t let fear consume you. And if you’re not having fun, you’re not going to be excellent.
- Be a Generalist
  - Generalists are rare...and, therefore, precious.
- When the pressure is on, a smart businessperson will turn to a software professional who can solve the problem at hand.
- you might pigeonhole yourself into architect as opposed to being a programmer or tester.
- Programmer geeks can’t lead, and leaders can’t hack. It’s rare to find someone who’s even decent at both.
- Be a Specialist


## Work and Health 

- Meditation - this can be a game changer. 
    - Not hours but just 10-15 mins a day. 
    - Forget the notion of ‘I’m unable to have no thoughts hence I’m bad at this’. 
    - It is now backed with hard data how even a small amount of meditation can do wonders.
- Strength training - 
    - As you grow older, it’s important to put in some time (20-30 mins) into inculcating strength training workouts. 
    - You can start with just your body weight and then progress to small weights. 
    - Any form of consistent exercise over a period of time can give you the right endorphin & cortisol recipe you need!
- Sleep - If you can master your sleep, you’ll maximise the effects of point 1 and 2. There is research that shows that even an hour of less than optimum sleep can throw your cognition off by 40%. So fix a wake up time and work back wards.
- Breathing - I read this fascinating study somewhere that we are breathing too fast as a generation! You read that right. The optimum amount of breaths per minute should be around 5-8 breaths. Over the last 40 years, the average human is breathing about 10-16 breaths. Breathing slowly can help inprove dental health and heart health! Shocking right?
