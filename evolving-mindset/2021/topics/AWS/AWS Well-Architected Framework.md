## AWS Well-Architected Framework
- The framework is based on five pillars:
    - Operational Excellence
    - Security
    - Reliability
    - Performance Efficiency
    - Cost Optimization

### Introduction
- Understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS. 
- Learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud. 
- Consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.
- The process for reviewing an architecture is a constructive conversation about architectural decisions, and is not an audit mechanism. 
- Well-architected systems greatly increases the likelihood of business success.
- Understand if a specific architecture aligns well with cloud best practices. 
- Evaluating systems against 
    - the qualities you expect from modern cloud-based systems, and 
    - the remediation that would be required to achieve those qualities. 
- It describes AWS best practices and strategies to use when designing and operating a cloud workload, and provides links to further implementation details and architectural patterns. 
- The AWS Well-Architected Tool (AWS WA Tool) is a service in the cloud that provides 
    - a consistent process for you to review and 
    - measure your architecture using the AWS Well-Architected Framework. 
    - The AWS WA Tool provides recommendations for making your workloads more reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective.
