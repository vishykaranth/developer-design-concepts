## What exactly is Amazon Lambda? How does it work?
- Before understanding what AWS lambda is… We need to know what serverless computing means….
- Serverless allows to build, deploy & run applications & services without worring about Servers (Server operational responsibilites like OS & firmware updates, Server Maintainence & timely Upgrades, Optimizations, Security, Mitigating powerfailures are managed by cloud provider)
- Example of Serverless Vs. Managed Service:

- AWS Lambda:
    - it is a computing service that lets to run our code without provisioning & managing AWS servers. 
    - The demand for serverless computing is exponentially growing day-by-day due to the technology advancements.

- Building blocks of AWS Lambda:
    - Lambda Function: Our own piece of code & libraries we used, are created as a Lambda function.
    - Log streams: helps monitoring & logging our lambda functions. We can also view its metrics on CloudWatch.
    - Event source: Any AWS Service or Custom service that triggers our lambda function to perform its task.

- Event sources that trigger lambda function are of two types:
    - Automatic Invocation: Here Event source mapping is not needed. Ex.

- Manual Invocation: Here we need to Map the event source with lambda function so that it can be triggered.

- Features of AWS Lambda:
    - Serverless (no need to manage servers),
    - Event driven (triggered by other aws services)
    - Bring your own code (upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run it)
    - helps to auto-scale your code with high availability
    - Pay only for the compute time consumed.
    - helps monitoring code performance in real time through CloudWatch
