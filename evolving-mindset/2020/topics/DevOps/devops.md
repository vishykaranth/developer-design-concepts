## Devops 
- DevOps is the 
    - set of concepts, 
    - practices, 
    - tools, and 
    - team organizational structures 
    - that enable organizations to more quickly release new capabilities to their clients. 
- Organizations that adopt DevOps are more easily able to release and monitor their microservices. 
- They are able to respond quickly to new requirements, or to problems that occur in production. 
- DevOps commonly includes the following processes:
    - Agile practices (http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
    - Continuous integration
    - Release automation
    - Functional unit testing
    - System integration testing
    - Service and infrastructure monitoring
- DevOps is a prerequisite to successfully adopting microservices
    - Microservices architecture results in more frequent and
    - greater numbers of smaller applications (microservices) being deployed. 
    - DevOps is what enables you to do more frequent deployments, and 
    - to scale to handle the growing number of new teams releasing microservices.

    - Culture
    - Code everything - application and configuration
