## Event Driven System 
- Kafka, 
    - is a streaming platform
    - emphasis on high throughput events and 
    - stream processing. 
- A Kafka cluster is 
    - a distributed system at heart, 
    - providing high availability, 
    - storage, and 
    - linear scale-out.
- Kafka is designed to move data, 
    - operating on that data as it does so.
    - Itâ€™s about real-time processing first, long-term storage second.
